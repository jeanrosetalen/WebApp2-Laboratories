I think the partition of task should be clear first for each worker, 
in the very beginning of the project. It would help if the project manager 
divided the task into more managable task for each employees, 
so that it won't be hard to look for who'll gonna do what.

And also, the actual deadline of the project should not be 
the deadline for everyone. The project manager should have made 
a set of due date for each tasks, so that they could harmonized 
and they could monitor the progress of each tasks. 
And there would be no delays, and no unfinished tasks.
